Tell me what you know about the company Red Hat
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a comprehensive overview of Red Hat, Inc., one of the most influential companies in open-source and enterprise software:
🧑‍💻 What Red Hat Is

Red Hat, Inc. is an American software company and a leader in open-source technologies, especially for enterprise IT infrastructure and cloud computing. It develops and supports open-source software solutions that businesses use to build, deploy, and manage applications across hybrid cloud environments.

Founded: 1993 by Bob Young and Marc Ewing.

Headquarters: Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.

Employees: ~19,000.

Parent Company: IBM acquired Red Hat in 2019 for about US $34 billion, one of the largest software acquisitions ever.
🧠 Open Source and Business Model

Red Hat’s business model is based on open source software — software whose source code is publicly accessible and can be freely modified and shared. Rather than selling proprietary software licenses, Red Hat charges for subscriptions that include technical support, training, certification, and integration services.

The company actively contributes to many open-source communities and projects around the world (e.g., Kubernetes, Fedora, Linux kernel development), and often takes community-built projects and “enterprise-hardens” them for reliability, security, and long-term support.
🧰 Key Products and Technologies

Red Hat offers a broad range of software and services for modern IT environments:

1. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

    The company’s flagship enterprise operating system — widely used by businesses and governments globally.

2. Hybrid Cloud & Platform Tools

    Red Hat OpenShift: A Kubernetes-based container platform for building cloud-native applications.

Ansible Automation Platform: Tools for enterprise automation of IT tasks.

3. Middleware, Virtualization, and Management

    Middleware and integration tools (historically including JBoss).

Virtualization solutions (Red Hat Virtualization).

4. Edge computing, AI, and developer services

    Capabilities for edge deployments, AI-driven workloads, and comprehensive enterprise support.

🌍 Market Presence

Red Hat products and subscriptions are used worldwide, and the company is especially popular with large organizations:

    Trusted by over 90% of Fortune 500 companies.

Offices in more than 40 countries.

Because of its open-source foundations and enterprise support model, Red Hat plays a central role in many companies’ IT modernization, cloud transformation, and automation strategies.
📈 Culture and Community

Red Hat is known for:

    A strong commitment to open-source community participation — contributing code back to upstream projects.

Supporting initiatives like Fedora (a community distribution that serves as an upstream innovation source for RHEL).

Offering training and certification programs widely recognized in the tech industry.
🧩 Relationship with IBM

Since the IBM acquisition in 2019, Red Hat has operated as an independent subsidiary with a focus on preserving its open-source culture while integrating with IBM’s broader enterprise strategy.

If you want, I can also explain specific Red Hat products in more detail (like RHEL, OpenShift, or Ansible) or how the company fits into current trends like AI and cloud computing.
You said:
How does the company's offering of technical support for subscription work?
ChatGPT said:

Red Hat’s subscription-based technical support is central to how the company makes money from open-source software. Here’s how it works in practice, step by step.
1. What You’re Actually Buying

When a company buys a Red Hat subscription, they are not buying the software license (the software is open source). They are buying:

    Access to tested, enterprise-ready builds

    Security updates and patches

    Technical support from Red Hat engineers

    Long-term lifecycle guarantees

    Tools, documentation, and management portals

    Legal assurances (e.g., IP indemnification)

Think of it as insurance + expertise + stability for running critical systems.
2. Subscription Structure

Subscriptions are usually priced per system, per core, or per cluster, depending on the product.

For example:

    RHEL → per server or virtual machine

    OpenShift → per CPU core

    Ansible Automation Platform → per managed node

Subscriptions are time-based (typically 1–3 years) and must be renewed to keep receiving updates and support.
3. Support Levels (SLAs)

Red Hat offers different support tiers, each with defined service-level agreements (SLAs):
Standard Support

    Business-hours support

    Web and phone access

    Slower response times

    Suitable for non-mission-critical workloads

Premium Support

    24/7 support

    Faster response times

    Phone + web

    Designed for production, mission-critical systems

Each tier defines:

    Response time (how fast Red Hat acknowledges an issue)

    Severity levels (impact on business)

    Availability (business hours vs. 24/7)

4. How a Support Case Works

    Customer opens a support case

        Via Red Hat Customer Portal (web)

        Or by phone (for high-severity issues)

    Issue is classified by severity

        Severity 1: System down / production outage

        Severity 2–4: Decreasing levels of impact

    Red Hat support engineers respond

        They help with troubleshooting, configuration, performance, bugs, and failures

        They may request logs, diagnostics, or system data

    Engineering escalation if needed

        If it’s a product bug, the case is escalated to Red Hat’s engineering teams

        Fixes may come as patches, workarounds, or future updates

5. Updates, Patches, and Lifecycle

Subscriptions include:

    Security updates (including critical CVEs)

    Bug fixes

    Minor and major version updates

Red Hat is known for long support lifecycles:

    RHEL versions are supported for 10+ years

    This is crucial for enterprises that can’t upgrade frequently

Without an active subscription:

    You can still legally run the software

    But you lose access to updates, patches, and support

6. Certified Ecosystem & Stability

Subscriptions also give access to:

    Certified hardware (servers, storage, cloud platforms)

    Certified software (databases, applications, drivers)

This reduces risk for enterprises by ensuring:

    Vendors will support the full stack

    Problems won’t be blamed on “unsupported configurations”

7. Legal and Business Value

An often-overlooked part:

    Red Hat provides IP indemnification

    If there’s a legal issue around open-source code, Red Hat stands behind the customer

This is extremely important for large enterprises and governments.
8. Why Customers Pay for This

Organizations pay for Red Hat subscriptions because they get:

    Predictable costs

    Enterprise-grade reliability

    Expert help when things break at 3 a.m.

    Long-term stability without vendor lock-in

In short:

    Red Hat sells confidence and continuity, not code.

If you want, I can:

    Compare Red Hat’s model to Ubuntu/Canonical

    Explain why companies don’t just use free Linux

    Walk through a real-world support case example

    Explain how this model works specifically for OpenShift or Ansible

Just tell me.
You said:
Let's walk through a real-world support case example
ChatGPT said:

Great—let’s walk through a concrete, realistic Red Hat support case from start to finish. I’ll use RHEL as the example, but the flow is very similar for OpenShift and Ansible.
Scenario Overview

Company: Mid-size financial services firm
Environment:

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

    Running a customer-facing payment application

    24/7 production system

    Premium Support subscription

Problem:
After a routine kernel update and reboot, one production server fails to come back online. The application is down.

This is a Severity 1 (critical) issue.
Step 1: Issue Occurs (Customer Side)

    Monitoring alerts trigger

    Operations team attempts:

        Reboot → fails

        Roll back application → impossible (OS not booting)

    Business impact:

        Payments failing

        Revenue loss per minute

Decision: Call Red Hat Support immediately
Step 2: Opening the Support Case

Because it’s Severity 1:

    Customer calls Red Hat’s 24/7 support phone line

    Provides:

        Subscription number

        System details (RHEL version, kernel version)

        Short description: “System fails to boot after kernel update”

Red Hat:

    Opens a Severity 1 case

    Assigns a Senior Support Engineer

    SLA: Response in minutes, not hours

Step 3: Initial Triage (Red Hat Support)

The support engineer:

    Confirms severity and impact

    Asks for:

        Boot error messages

        Console output (via iLO / IPMI / cloud console)

        Whether this occurred on multiple systems

They identify:

    Kernel panic related to a storage driver

Step 4: Deep Troubleshooting

Red Hat support walks the customer through:

    Booting into an older kernel

        Using GRUB menu

        Confirms system boots successfully

    Collecting diagnostics

        sosreport from the working kernel

        Kernel version comparison

    Root cause identification

        A known regression affecting a specific RAID controller

        Triggered only on certain firmware versions

At this point:

    Red Hat confirms: this is a product bug

Step 5: Escalation to Engineering

Because it’s a confirmed bug:

    Support escalates the case to Red Hat Engineering

    Engineering:

        Confirms issue matches an internal bug report

        Provides a temporary workaround

Workaround:

    Blacklist the problematic driver module

    Use the previous kernel until a fix is available

Support engineer:

    Stays on the call while workaround is applied

    Confirms system boots and application is restored

⏱️ Downtime reduced from hours to ~45 minutes
Step 6: Permanent Fix Delivered

A few days later:

    Red Hat releases a patched kernel update

    Support notifies the customer via the case

    Provides:

        Patch advisory

        Safe upgrade instructions

        Recommendation for rolling deployment

Customer:

    Applies fix first in staging

    Then production

    Closes the case

Step 7: Post-Incident Value

What the subscription delivered:

✅ Immediate access to experts
✅ Rapid root cause identification
✅ Direct engineering escalation
✅ Temporary workaround
✅ Permanent fix
✅ Confidence the issue won’t recur

Without a subscription:

    The company would have relied on forums

    No guaranteed response time

    No engineering escalation

    Higher downtime and business risk

How This Differs for OpenShift (Quick Note)

For OpenShift, a similar case might involve:

    Cluster not upgrading

    Nodes stuck in NotReady

    Operators failing health checks

Red Hat support would:

    Analyze cluster state

    Review operator logs

    Provide rollback or upgrade path

    Coordinate fixes across Kubernetes, OS, and platform layers

Key Takeaway

A Red Hat support case is not just:

    “Here’s a workaround, good luck.”

It’s:

    A guided, accountable process backed by engineering and long-term fixes.

If you’d like, next we can:

    Walk through an OpenShift outage example

    Show what happens in a non-critical (Severity 3) case

    Compare this with community-only support

    Explain what Red Hat support will not help with (important nuance)

Just say the word.
You said:
In Step 4: Depp Troubleshooting part 2. Collecting diagnostics it talked about retrieving an sosreport from the working kernel? What is an sosreport?
ChatGPT said:

An sosreport is a standardized diagnostic snapshot of a Linux system that Red Hat support uses to quickly understand what’s going on with a machine—without having to manually ask you for dozens of files.

Think of it as a “black box flight recorder” for a RHEL system.
What sosreport Is

sosreport is a tool (part of the sos package) that:

    Collects system configuration

    Gathers logs and runtime information

    Captures hardware, storage, and networking details

    Packages everything into one compressed archive

It does not modify the system. It only reads data.
Why Red Hat Uses It

Instead of asking:

    “Send /var/log/messages”

    “What kernel modules are loaded?”

    “What’s your storage configuration?”

    “What kernel parameters are set?”

Red Hat support can say:

    “Please upload an sosreport.”

This gives them a complete, consistent view of the system in minutes.
What an sosreport Contains (High Level)

An sosreport typically includes:
System Basics

    OS version and release

    Kernel version(s)

    Boot parameters

    Installed RPMs

Logs

    /var/log/messages

    journalctl output

    Boot logs

    dmesg (kernel ring buffer)

Hardware & Drivers

    PCI devices (lspci)

    Loaded kernel modules

    Storage controllers

    CPU and memory info

Storage & Filesystems

    Block devices

    RAID/LVM configuration

    Filesystem mount info

    /etc/fstab

Networking

    Interface configuration

    Routing tables

    Firewall rules

Services & Processes

    systemd unit states

    Running processes

    Resource usage snapshots

Red Hat–Specific Metadata

    Subscription status

    Installed Red Hat packages

    SELinux status and logs

Why “From the Working Kernel” Matters

In the earlier example:

    The new kernel fails to boot

    The previous kernel boots successfully

Red Hat support asks for an sosreport from the working kernel because:

    It lets them inspect:

        Hardware drivers

        Kernel modules

        Storage configuration

    They can compare:

        Working vs. failing kernel versions

    The data is still relevant because:

        Hardware and configuration haven’t changed

        Only the kernel version differs

This is often enough to identify regressions or incompatible drivers.
How You Generate One (Typical Flow)

sudo sosreport

During execution:

    You’ll be asked to:

        Enter a case number (so Red Hat can associate it)

        Optionally enable data redaction

Output:

    A file like:

    sosreport-myhost-2026-01-29-abc123.tar.xz

You then:

    Upload it via the Red Hat Customer Portal

    Or provide it via secure upload if instructed

Security & Privacy Considerations

Important points enterprises care about:

    🔒 Read-only (no system changes)

    🔒 Can mask sensitive data (passwords, keys, tokens)

    🔒 Red Hat support handles it under contractual confidentiality

That said:

    It may still include:

        IP addresses

        Hostnames

        Internal topology details

    Many orgs review or redact before uploading (Red Hat supports this)

Why It’s So Central to Red Hat Support

For Red Hat engineers, an sosreport:

    Reduces back-and-forth questions

    Speeds up root cause analysis

    Makes escalation to engineering faster

    Creates a repeatable support workflow

In practice:

    No serious Red Hat support case proceeds without an sosreport.

One Important Limitation

sosreport is a snapshot, not a live trace:

    It won’t capture transient issues unless they’re logged

    For performance problems, support may also ask for:

        perf

        strace

        tcpdump

        or OpenShift-specific diagnostics

If you want, I can next:

    Walk through an actual sosreport directory structure

    Explain how plugins work inside sos

    Show what data Red Hat support typically checks first

    Compare sosreport with tools like supportconfig (SUSE) or apport (Ubuntu)

Just tell me where to go next.
You said:
Lets walk through an actual sosreport directory structure
ChatGPT said:

Great idea. Walking the structure makes sosreport click very quickly.

Below is a realistic, simplified sosreport directory tree, followed by what Red Hat engineers actually look at first and why each area exists.
1. Top-Level Structure

When you extract an sosreport:

tar -xf sosreport-myhost-2026-01-29-abc123.tar.xz
cd sosreport-myhost-2026-01-29-abc123/

You’ll see something like:

.
├── sosreport.log
├── sos_commands/
├── etc/
├── proc/
├── sys/
├── var/
├── usr/
├── root/
├── boot/
├── lib/
├── run/
└── version.txt

2. version.txt (Start Here)

Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.9 (Ootpa)
sos version 4.6.0

Why it matters:

    Confirms OS version

    Confirms sos tool version

    Helps support understand what collectors ran

📌 This is usually the first file a support engineer opens.
3. sosreport.log

sosreport starting...
Running plugin kernel
Running plugin storage
Running plugin networking
...

Purpose:

    Shows which plugins ran

    Shows failures or skipped collectors

    Explains missing data

If something is missing, this file explains why.
4. sos_commands/ (Command Output Goldmine)

This is the most-used directory.

sos_commands/
├── kernel/
│   ├── uname_-a
│   ├── lsmod
│   ├── sysctl_-a
│   └── dmesg
├── hardware/
│   ├── lspci_-vv
│   ├── lsusb
│   └── free_-m
├── storage/
│   ├── lsblk
│   ├── blkid
│   ├── pvs
│   ├── vgs
│   └── lvs
├── networking/
│   ├── ip_addr
│   ├── ip_route
│   └── ss_-lntup
└── process/
    ├── ps_auxww
    └── top_-b_-n_1

Why this is critical

Each file is the exact output of a command run at collection time.

Example:

cat sos_commands/kernel/uname_-a

Output is literally what uname -a returned on that system.

📌 Support engineers trust this more than screenshots or copy-paste.
5. etc/ (Configuration Snapshot)

etc/
├── fstab
├── hosts
├── passwd
├── group
├── sysctl.conf
├── default/
├── systemd/
│   └── system.conf
└── NetworkManager/

This mirrors /etc (with sensitive data masked).

Used to:

    Verify filesystem mounts

    Check sysctl tuning

    Review service configuration

    Spot misconfigurations

6. var/log/ (Historical Evidence)

var/log/
├── messages
├── secure
├── dmesg
├── boot.log
└── journal/

Why it matters:

    Shows what happened before failure

    Kernel panics often appear here

    Authentication or SELinux issues surface here

📌 If the system crashed earlier, this is where clues live.
7. boot/ (Kernel & Bootloader)

boot/
├── grub2/
│   └── grub.cfg
├── config-4.18.0-513.el8.x86_64
└── vmlinuz-4.18.0-513.el8.x86_64

Used to:

    Confirm installed kernels

    Inspect boot parameters

    Check default kernel selection

This is key in kernel regression cases.
8. proc/ and sys/ (Runtime State)

proc/
├── cmdline
├── cpuinfo
└── meminfo

sys/
└── block/

These capture kernel-exposed runtime information.

Useful for:

    CPU topology

    Memory layout

    Block device details

9. Plugin-Specific Directories

Some products add extra folders, for example:
SELinux

sos_commands/selinux/
├── sestatus
└── sealert_-l_*

Containers / OpenShift

sos_commands/containers/
├── podman_ps
├── crictl_ps
└── oc_get_nodes

Support engineers jump straight here for product-specific cases.
10. What Support Looks At First (Real Order)

In a kernel boot failure case, Red Hat engineers typically:

    version.txt

    sosreport.log

    sos_commands/kernel/

    boot/grub2/grub.cfg

    sos_commands/storage/

    var/log/messages or journal

They are hunting for:

    Driver mismatches

    Unsupported hardware

    Regression signatures

    Known bug patterns

11. Why This Structure Matters

This layout:

    Is consistent across customers

    Is consistent across cases

    Allows fast pattern recognition

That’s why Red Hat can escalate cases efficiently:
Engineering teams already know where to look.
Final Mental Model

Think of an sosreport as:

    📁 A frozen, forensically useful filesystem + command output snapshot, organized for support engineers—not humans.

If you want next, I can:

    Walk through a real kernel regression example using these files

    Show how plugins decide what to collect

    Explain how to redact or customize sosreports

    Compare this with OpenShift must-gather

Just say where you want to dig deeper.
You said:
Explain how to redact or customize sosreports
ChatGPT said:

Redacting and customizing sosreport is a very common enterprise requirement, and Red Hat designed the tool with that in mind. I’ll break this into how redaction works, how to customize collection, and best-practice workflows support teams actually use.
1. Built-in Redaction (Automatic & Safe)
Default Behavior

By default, sosreport already masks obvious secrets, including:

    Password fields in config files

    Authentication tokens

    Some private keys

You don’t need to do anything extra for basic safety.
Enabling Extra Redaction

When running:

sudo sosreport

You’ll be prompted:

Do you want to enable automatic redaction of sensitive data? (y/N)

Answer y to:

    Obfuscate usernames

    Mask IP addresses

    Mask hostnames

    Scrub MAC addresses

📌 This is commonly used in regulated environments.
How Redaction Actually Works

Redaction is handled by regex-based filters inside sos plugins.

Example (conceptual):

192.168.10.45  →  XXX.XXX.XX.XX
db-prod-01    →  hostname-REDACTED

Important nuance:

    Redaction preserves structure, not values

    This allows troubleshooting without leaking details

2. Manual Redaction (Post-Collection)

Many organizations do manual review before upload.
Typical Workflow

tar -xf sosreport-*.tar.xz
cd sosreport-*/

Then:

    Open sensitive files:

        etc/fstab

        etc/hosts

        sos_commands/networking/ip_addr

    Replace values manually

    Repack the archive

tar -cJf sosreport-redacted.tar.xz sosreport-*/

📌 Red Hat explicitly allows this.

⚠️ Warning: Over-redaction can slow support if critical context is removed.
3. Selective Plugin Control (Customize What’s Collected)

sosreport is plugin-based. You can include or exclude entire data domains.
List Available Plugins

sosreport -l

Example output:

kernel
storage
networking
selinux
security
containers

Disable Specific Plugins

Example: exclude networking data

sudo sosreport -k networking.skip=true

Or exclude SELinux info:

sudo sosreport -k selinux.skip=true

📌 Useful if:

    Security policies forbid sharing certain configs

    The issue is unrelated (e.g., pure storage problem)

Enable Only Certain Plugins

Example: kernel + storage only

sudo sosreport -o kernel,storage

This:

    Reduces collection size

    Limits exposure

    Speeds up upload

4. File-Level Exclusions

You can exclude specific paths:

sudo sosreport --exclude=/etc/ssh

Or multiple:

sudo sosreport \
  --exclude=/etc/ssh \
  --exclude=/etc/pki

📌 Common for:

    SSH host keys

    Internal PKI infrastructure

5. Case-Aware Collection (Best Practice)

Always associate the sosreport with a case:

sudo sosreport --case-id=01234567

Benefits:

    Red Hat support sees it immediately

    Engineers know the context

    Faster triage

6. Performance & Safety Considerations

    Collection is read-only

    Usually takes 2–10 minutes

    Safe on production systems

    Disk usage: typically 50–300 MB compressed

For very busy systems:

sudo sosreport --batch

(skips prompts)
7. What Not to Remove (Important)

Avoid redacting:

    Kernel version info

    Hardware identifiers (model, vendor)

    Driver/module names

    Storage topology

These are often required to identify known bugs.
8. Red Hat Support Reality Check

If something essential is missing:

    Support will ask for a follow-up sosreport

    Or a targeted command output

They won’t reject a redacted report—but they will need enough signal to help.
9. Comparison: sosreport vs OpenShift must-gather
Tool	Purpose	Redaction
sosreport	OS-level diagnostics	Built-in + manual
must-gather	OpenShift cluster state	Namespace filtering

They’re often used together in OpenShift cases.
Final Takeaway

The goal is:

    Maximize diagnostic value while minimizing sensitive exposure.

sosreport gives you:

    Automated redaction

    Plugin-level control

    File-level exclusion

    Manual review flexibility

Which is why it’s trusted in finance, healthcare, and government environments.

If you want next, I can:

    Show example redaction before/after

    Explain writing custom sos plugins

    Walk through OpenShift must-gather redaction

    Share enterprise sosreport policies/templates

Just tell me where to go next.
You said:
What is the OpenShift must-gather?
ChatGPT said:

OpenShift must-gather is the cluster-level diagnostic tool used by Red Hat support for OpenShift in the same way sosreport is used for RHEL—but scoped to Kubernetes and the OpenShift platform, not the underlying OS.

If sosreport is a server snapshot, must-gather is a full OpenShift cluster snapshot.
1. What must-gather Is (In One Sentence)

    must-gather collects the complete state of an OpenShift cluster—API objects, logs, and configuration—so Red Hat can diagnose cluster and platform issues.

It is:

    Read-only

    Non-disruptive

    The first thing Red Hat support asks for in OpenShift cases

2. Why It Exists

OpenShift problems often involve:

    Kubernetes control plane

    Operators

    CRDs

    Etcd

    Networking overlays

    Nodes + containers + OS

You cannot debug this reliably with ad-hoc commands.

must-gather:

    Standardizes data collection

    Ensures nothing critical is missed

    Matches Red Hat’s internal troubleshooting playbooks

3. What must-gather Collects

At a high level, it gathers:
Kubernetes / OpenShift Objects

    All namespaces (or selected ones)

    Pods, deployments, daemonsets

    Nodes and node conditions

    Events (very important)

OpenShift-Specific Components

    Cluster Operators (COs)

    Operator logs

    OpenShift APIs

    Cluster configuration resources

Logs

    Control plane logs

    Operator logs

    Node-related logs (via pods)

Platform Metadata

    OpenShift version

    Upgrade history

    Feature gates

    Cluster networking config

📌 This is logical state, not filesystem state (unlike sosreport).
4. How must-gather Is Run

From a machine with oc access:

oc adm must-gather

This:

    Creates a temporary must-gather pod

    Runs collectors inside the cluster

    Writes output locally

Result:

must-gather/
└── local/
    ├── cluster-scoped-resources/
    ├── namespaces/
    ├── operators/
    ├── nodes/
    └── version

You then:

    Compress the directory

    Upload it to the Red Hat case

5. Directory Structure (Conceptual)

must-gather/
├── version
├── cluster-scoped-resources/
│   ├── config.openshift.io/
│   ├── operator.openshift.io/
│   └── machineconfiguration.openshift.io/
├── namespaces/
│   ├── openshift-kube-apiserver/
│   ├── openshift-etcd/
│   └── default/
├── operators/
│   ├── cluster-version-operator/
│   └── network-operator/
└── nodes/
    ├── node-1/
    └── node-2/

This structure is intentionally predictable, just like sosreport.
6. Relationship to sosreport (Very Important)
Tool	Scope	Layer
sosreport	Single OS	Linux / RHEL
must-gather	Entire cluster	Kubernetes / OpenShift
Both together	Full picture	Platform + OS

In real support cases:

    Red Hat often asks for both
    must-gather → cluster logic
    sosreport → node/OS issues

7. Custom must-gather Images (Advanced but Common)

OpenShift supports specialized must-gather collectors.

Examples:

    Storage (ODF, Ceph)

    Networking (OVN, SDN)

    Service Mesh

    Logging

    Virtualization

Example:

oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-must-gather

or vendor-specific collectors.

📌 This is how Red Hat gets deep subsystem data without manual steps.
8. Redaction & Security Model

    No secrets are intentionally collected

    Kubernetes secrets are metadata only, not values

    Output is plain text and YAML

    Customers can review and redact before upload

However:

    Internal IPs

    Hostnames

    Namespace names

    Application names

👉 These are usually required for troubleshooting.
9. When Red Hat Will Ask for must-gather

Almost always for:

    Cluster upgrades failing

    Operators degraded

    Nodes stuck NotReady

    Control plane instability

    Networking or storage issues

    Performance or scaling problems

If the case mentions OpenShift:

    Assume must-gather is coming.

10. Mental Model (Best Way to Remember)

    sosreport = “What does this Linux system look like?”

    must-gather = “What does this OpenShift cluster believe its state is?”

Both are snapshots.
Both are structured.
Both are required for serious support.
Final Takeaway

OpenShift must-gather is the authoritative diagnostic artifact for OpenShift support.

If you don’t provide it:

    Triage slows dramatically

    Engineers can’t escalate to product teams

    Root cause analysis stalls

If you want next, I can:

    Walk through a real OpenShift outage using must-gather

    Compare default vs custom must-gather

    Explain how operators log and surface failures

    Show how must-gather changes during upgrades

Are there any ChatGPT apps available to help with Red Hat Support?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — there are AI-powered tools and integrations that can help with Red Hat support work, ranging from official Red Hat assistants to general ChatGPT-based helpers you might use as part of troubleshooting workflows:
🔹 1. Ask Red Hat — Official AI Assistant (Integrated with Red Hat Support)

Red Hat has launched an AI-powered assistant called “Ask Red Hat” directly in the Red Hat Customer Portal. It’s designed specifically for Red Hat customers and subscribers to:

    Answer natural-language questions about Red Hat products.

    Surface relevant knowledgebase articles, documentation, and advisories.

    Help you find the right tools or support resources faster.

It’s built on an OpenAI/IBM-class model and is tailored to Red Hat content, not general web search, so the answers are aligned with official Red Hat guidance.

Where to find it:
You access it when logged into the Red Hat Customer Portal — it’s not a standalone app but an integrated support tool.
🔹 2. Red Hat Developer Lightspeed / AI Assistance Tools

Red Hat is also rolling out AI-powered productivity assistants under the Lightspeed umbrella. These aren’t exactly “Red Hat support chat apps” in the traditional sense, but they provide context-aware AI help for developers working with Red Hat tools, documentation, and workflows (including troubleshooting advice and code/documentation assistance).

While these are more developer-oriented than purely support-oriented, they can be extremely helpful when diagnosing issues in app stacks running on Red Hat platforms.
🔹 3. Home-Brew or Community ChatGPT Bots

There are third-party ChatGPT-based bots built around RHEL or Linux support concepts (e.g., “Red Hat Enterprise Linux Assistant” bots found on some bot directories or platforms), but these are not official Red Hat products — they use general GPT tech to answer Linux questions (and might help with basic troubleshooting).

⚠️ Caution: These unofficial tools aren’t tied to Red Hat’s support knowledgebase and do not replace official support or portal access. They’re more like automated helpers with general Linux knowledge.
🔹 4. General ChatGPT Apps (via ChatGPT Apps & Extensions)

OpenAI’s ChatGPT apps/connector ecosystem lets you bring external tools or data into conversations (for example, connecting internal docs, logs, or ticket systems). While there isn’t yet an official Red Hat support app in that ecosystem, you can:

    Build or integrate custom apps that inject your internal Red Hat knowledge, logs, or documentation into ChatGPT.

    Use interactive apps in ChatGPT that help with workflows, research, or leveraging your data.

This is more of a developer-customized option than a plug-and-play support bot.
🧠 Summary: What’s Available Now
Tool	Purpose	Official?
Ask Red Hat (Portal Chatbot)	Natural-language access to support content and docs	✅ Yes
Red Hat Developer Lightspeed	AI assistance for developer workflows	✅ Yes
Third-party ChatGPT Linux Bots	Community AI helpers for troubleshooting	❌ No
ChatGPT Apps / Connectors	Custom integrations with your own system data	🟡 Possible with development
🧩 How These Help in Real Support Cases

    Ask Red Hat can quickly surface relevant KB articles, advisories, and support tickets related to error messages or specific symptoms you describe — saving time in triage.

Lightspeed tools can help with understanding logs, config issues, or debugging output in context.

    Custom ChatGPT integrations can bring your own internal scripts, logs, or case history to bear in a conversational troubleshooting session — if you build or configure them.

If you’d like, I can show:

    How to enable or access Ask Red Hat step-by-step in your Red Hat Customer Portal,

    Or examples of prompts that get the most accurate support guidance from these tools.

You said:
Is the sosreport tool installed on red hat enterprise linux 9 and 10 by default?
ChatGPT said:

Short answer:
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and 10, the sosreport-style tool (sos report) is not guaranteed to be installed by default in all installation cases — especially minimal installations.

Here’s what that means in practice:
📌 RHEL 9

    A minimal installation of RHEL 9 does not include the sos package that provides the sosreport / sos report command by default.

On more complete server installations (e.g., “Server with GUI” or “Standard System”), it may already be present, but you should verify.

If it’s not available, you must install it manually:

sudo dnf install sos

After installation, the command you’ll use is:

sudo sos report

(On RHEL 8+ this replaced the older sosreport command, though sosreport may still redirect for compatibility.)
📌 RHEL 10

    RHEL 10 behaves similarly: it does not guarantee that the sos package is installed by default on all installation profiles.

    So you may need to install it yourself using:

sudo dnf install sos

Once installed, generate a report with:

    sudo sos report

🧠 Why This Matters

    Minimal installs are common for production systems where administrators want only essential packages installed — this reduces attack surface and disk footprint.

Red Hat documentation notes that for RHEL 9 the sos utility may need to be installed separately if absent.
✅ Quick Verification

Before running a report, check if the command is available:

rpm -q sos

    If it prints a version → sos is installed.

    If it says “package sos is not installed” → install it with dnf install sos.

🛠 Running the Report

Once installed:

sudo sos report

This produces a diagnostic archive typically in /var/tmp/ that you can upload to Red Hat Support when opening a case.

If you’d like, I can show you how to install and run sos report step by step, including how to verify the package and handle scenarios where it’s missing.
You said:
By default in red hat enterprise linux 9 and 10 is there a container runtime available by default?
ChatGPT said:

Here’s how container runtimes are handled by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 and 10:
🟢 Default Container Tools and Runtimes
📌 Podman and Related Tools

    Podman, along with container tooling like Buildah and Skopeo, are the supported tools for managing containers on RHEL 9 and RHEL 10 — and replace the older Docker engine entirely. Red Hat does not ship the Docker engine or the traditional docker package in the standard RHEL repos for RHEL 8 and later releases.

These tools are part of the “Container Tools” content Red Hat provides and are intended to be used for pulling, building, running, and managing OCI containers on the host.

    In other words: Podman is the supported container runtime toolset on RHEL 9 and 10.

🧰 What RHEL Includes by Default

Whether Podman is installed by default depends on the installation profile you choose:

    Minimal or custom lightweight installations may not include container tooling by default.

    On more complete systems (like standard server installs with development or container tooling groups), Podman often is available without manual installation.

    In many RHEL images, Podman and its dependencies are part of the default package set — but you should verify on your specific install.

If Podman is not present, you can install it easily:

sudo dnf install podman

And for the broader toolset:

sudo dnf install buildah skopeo

(Or install the full container tools meta-package where applicable.)
⚙️ What Underlies Podman

Podman itself uses an OCI (Open Container Initiative) runtime to actually run containers. On RHEL:

    RHEL 9: Uses crun as the default container runtime by default (with runc also available).

RHEL 10: Also uses crun as the default runtime; the older runc is removed or optional per documentation.

This runtime (crun) is what actually implements the container process isolation — Podman is the tooling layer above it.
🚫 Docker Engine and Traditional Runtime

    The Docker engine (daemon) and docker package are not included or supported by default in RHEL 9 and RHEL 10.

You can install Docker from external repositories if you want, but:

    It won’t be supported by Red Hat’s official repos,

    It might require custom configuration, and

    Red Hat recommends Podman instead.

Podman can even provide a compatibility layer so commands like docker run work via Podman by installing podman-docker, which makes Podman respond to the Docker CLI.
🧩 Summary
Feature / Version	Default Present?	Notes
Podman (container engine)	📦 Usually / Yes	Supported container runtime toolset, central in RHEL 9/10
Buildah / Skopeo	📦 Often	Complementary container tooling
Docker engine	❌ No	Not included or supported by default
OCI runtime (crun)	📦 Yes (used by Podman)	Underlying container runtime execution
OCI runtime (runc)	Optional/older	Default in RHEL 9 alongside crun; RHEL 10 favors crun
🔍 Practical Check

On your RHEL system, you can confirm whether Podman is installed:

podman --version

If it’s not installed, the package can be added via dnf install podman.
📌 Bottom Line

    RHEL 9 and RHEL 10 do include container tooling, with Podman as the standard container engine once installed.

Traditional Docker is not provided by default, and Red Hat encourages using Podman and other OCI-compliant tools instead.

If you want, I can explain the differences between Podman and Docker, or show how the container runtime is used with Kubernetes/OpenShift on RHEL hosts. Just let me know!
You said:
Does ChatGPT have the ability to call the sos tool on red hat enterprise linux 9 and 10 if it is installed and available?
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: No. ChatGPT cannot directly call or run the sos / sosreport tool on RHEL 9 or 10, even if it is installed and available on the system.

Here’s the clear breakdown, because this is an important boundary to understand.
Why ChatGPT Cannot Run sos report
1. ChatGPT Has No Direct Access to Your Systems

ChatGPT:

    Does not have SSH access

    Does not run inside your RHEL host

    Does not have permission to execute OS commands

    Cannot interact with your filesystem, kernel, or processes

So it cannot do this:

sudo sos report

on your behalf.

This is true even if:

    The sos package is installed

    The system is RHEL 9 or 10

    You are logged in as root on your machine

What ChatGPT Can Do Instead (Very Effectively)

While ChatGPT can’t run sosreport, it can assist before, during, and after its use.
✅ Before Running sosreport

ChatGPT can:

    Tell you whether sos should be installed

    Help you choose plugins to include/exclude

    Recommend redaction options

    Help you decide which collectors are relevant to your issue

Example:

    “I’m troubleshooting a kernel panic on RHEL 9—what sos plugins should I include?”

✅ While Running sosreport

ChatGPT can:

    Provide the exact command to run

    Explain each flag:

    sudo sos report --case-id=01234567 -o kernel,storage

    Help you handle:

        Minimal installs

        Offline systems

        Air-gapped environments

✅ After Generating the sosreport

ChatGPT can:

    Explain the directory structure

    Help you understand what files Red Hat support will inspect

    Help you manually review or redact sensitive data

    Explain error messages if collection failed

You can also paste:

    Selected file contents

    Error output

    Logs from inside the sosreport

…and ChatGPT can help interpret them.
Important Security Boundary (By Design)

This limitation is intentional and desirable:

    Allowing an AI to execute system diagnostics would be a major security risk

    Enterprises require:

        Explicit operator control

        Auditable actions

        Human approval for data collection

Red Hat support follows the same rule:

    Support engineers never run sosreport directly on customer systems either.

You (or your automation) always run it.
Can ChatGPT Be Integrated Indirectly?

Yes — but only with tooling you control.
Common Patterns (Advanced / Enterprise)

    ChatGPT + Runbooks

        ChatGPT suggests commands

        Humans execute them

    ChatGPT + Automation

        You build a wrapper script that:

            Runs sos report

            Uploads artifacts

        ChatGPT helps design or reason about that workflow

    ChatGPT + Log Analysis

        You paste outputs from:

            sosreport files

            must-gather results

        ChatGPT helps analyze patterns

But even here:

    ChatGPT never initiates execution.

Comparison With Red Hat Tools
Tool	Can run sosreport?	Notes
ChatGPT	❌ No	Advisory / analytical only
Human admin	✅ Yes	Required
Script / Ansible	✅ Yes	You control execution
Red Hat Support	❌ No	Customer always runs it
OpenShift must-gather	❌ (indirect)	Still user-initiated
Bottom Line

    ChatGPT cannot call or execute sos report

    It can guide, explain, review, and analyze

    Execution always remains under your control

That separation is exactly what makes ChatGPT safe to use in enterprise support workflows.

If you want, next I can:

    Show a safe ChatGPT-assisted sosreport runbook

    Explain how teams standardize sos collection

    Compare human vs automated sosreport workflows

    Show how ChatGPT can help analyze sosreport + must-gather together
